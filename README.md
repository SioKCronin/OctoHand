# Akko

Akko is a deep RL agent leveraging insights gleaned from the cephalopod community. 


## Inspiration

Cephalopod intelligence is often observed in physical ability (shape-shifting, color changing, escape planning and execution). I believe they are a prime example of movement strategies that can be learned from nature.
