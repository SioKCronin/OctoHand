# octohand

octohand is a robotics testing environment featuring cephalopod appendages. 

## Inspiration

Cephalopod intelligence is often observed in physical ability (shape-shifting, color changing, escape planning and execution). I believe they are a prime example of movement strategies that can be learned from nature. 

I saw [this film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0iUlWnon9Y) and thought it would be interesting to develop RL agents that could use cephalopod-like appendages to open containers and navigate spaces.
